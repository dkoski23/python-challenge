PyBank and PyPoll

My PyBank project consists of using the os and csv modules along with a for loop, numpy arrays, and the print command to perform and store an analysis of some simple banking data. It reads the corresponding csv file from the Rescources folder and then returns the total number of months, net over said months, the average change from month to month, and the months which saw the greatest increase and decrease in profits. The program proceeds to print this data to the terminal and write a text file in the Analysis folder.

The PyPoll project also uses the os and csv modules, as well as a for loop and printing to analyze election data. Like PyBank, it both prints to terminal and writes the results to a text file. However, in this case the data returned is the total number of votes, the percentage of votes won by each candidate, the number of votes won by each candidate, and the winner of the election.
